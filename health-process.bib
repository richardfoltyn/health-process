	abstract = {Using biennial data from the Health and Retirement Study, we estimate age-dependent health dynamics and survival probabilities at annual frequency conditional on race, sex, and health for the US population. The health gradient in life expectancy is steep and persists after controlling for socioeconomic status. Moreover, even conditional on health and socioeconomic status, the racial gap in life expectancy remains large. Model simulations show that this gap affects savings rates but does not play a major role in explaining the racial wealth gap. However, we find that differences in mortality alone imply that black individuals on average can expect to receive 15 percent less in Social Security benefits in present value terms.},
